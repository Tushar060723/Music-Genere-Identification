# Music-Genere-Identification
The project contains a deep learning model that is capable of detecting the genre of a audio file. 
Overview

This project focuses on classifying music genres using deep learning techniques. It involves training a neural network on audio features extracted from a dataset of music tracks. The model is then tested to predict the genre of new music samples.
